# **How does it work**
The game chooses a country randomly from the available 48 countries. The flag of the chosen country, the hint associated with it and its name are extracted from a JSON file. Then the program generates 3 other countries to be options besides the correct one. If the user clicks on the correct option their score gets incremented.
Then the country is removed from the countries list that the program is randomly choosing from and the game continues. The hint button revealed the hint associated with the current country. In the and the score is displayed with a button that enables you to play again.
